									<h2>Poetry</h2>
									<p> Inspired by my grandfather's recital of various Iranian poems, I began writing poetry at the age of 14
                                        as a way to better process my emotions by communicating
                                        my thoughts and ideas to the world. I have previously published two poems with the Young Writers
                                        of Canada Association and continue to spend my free time writing poetry. </p>
                                        

                                        <p>   <a href="Poem/The Soul and Sleep BEST.pdf">Feel free to check out my published works here.</a> </p>
     </p>

     <h2>Piano</h2>
									<p> I have been playing piano ever since I was four years old. I have dabbled in various genres ranging from 
                                        classic music to traditional Iranian folk songs. I have also received my level 8 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music) 
                                        Certificiation. In my spare time, I enjoy singing and playing my favorite tunes for family and friends. </p>
                                        

     </p>

     <h2>Activities</h2>
									<p>I enjoy spending my free time being active. I play tennis with my sister on a weekly basis
                                        and we often explore Vancouver by going on hikes and checking out new trails. I also enjoy pilates
                                    and yoga workouts that help me ground myself when the weather isn't looking too great. </p>
